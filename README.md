# Notetaking Application

This is a note-taking desktop application built using **JavaFX** and **SQLite**, developed as part of a team project for the CAB302 Software Development unit at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

The goal of the application was to implement a structured, user-friendly platform where users can create, view, update, and delete notes — all stored locally using a database. The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The project simulates a real-world software development process, focusing on:
- GUI development using JavaFX
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Clean code design using MVC
- Optional integration of AI for content enhancement
- Team collaboration through Git version control

---

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Create and save notes with titles and content
- 🔍 View a list of saved notes in a structured layout
- 🖊️ Edit or delete existing notes
- 💾 Local data storage with SQLite
- 🧠 Clear separation of logic, data, and interface (MVC)
- 🤖 **AI-generated note expansion (in development)**

---

## 🤖 AI Functionality

The application includes a new **AI-enhanced note generation feature**, allowing users to upload rough or raw notes and receive an expanded, well-formatted version generated by a local LLM (Large Language Model).

- The AI backend is powered by **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**, which hosts a language model locally and exposes API endpoints on your machine.
- When a user enters rough notes and clicks the **"Generate"** button in the AI tab, the app:
  1. Sends a **POST HTTP request** to Ollama's local endpoint.
  2. Includes a structured prompt asking the AI to clean up, expand, and reformat the user's notes.
  3. Parses the **JSON response** to extract the generated content.
  4. Displays the AI-enhanced notes in the UI for the user to review or save.

> This feature is still a **work-in-progress** and will be enhanced over the coming weeks to support file uploads, model configuration, and formatting controls.
